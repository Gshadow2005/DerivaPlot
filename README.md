# DerivaPlot - Function Visualization Tool

DerivaPlot is a Python-based application that enables visualization of mathematical functions, their derivatives, and integrals using computational methods.

## How to Use DerivaPlot:

1. **Enter a mathematical function using x as the variable**
   - Examples: `sin(x)`, `x**2`, `cos(x) + 0.5*x`

2. **Set the X Range for plotting (min and max values)**
   - Example: `-10 to 10`

3. **Set the derivative order**
   - 1 for the first derivative, 2 for the second, etc.

4. **Additional Features:**
   - Click "+ Add Function" to plot multiple functions simultaneously
   - Use the "Show Critical Values" button to identify key points on the function
   - Use the "Show Roots" button to find and display function roots
   - Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing

5. **Click "Plot Functions" to visualize:**
   - The original function
   - The specified derivative
   - The integral of the function

6. **Use the navigation toolbar to:**
   - Zoom in/out
   - Pan the graph
   - Save the plot directly

7. **Additional Buttons:**
   - "Save Image": Export the graph as PNG, JPEG, or PDF
   - "Generate Report": Create a comprehensive function analysis report
   - "Refresh": Update the plot without clearing inputs
   - "Reset": Clear all inputs and reset the graph

## Supported Mathematical Functions:
- Basic Operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`
- Trigonometric: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- Exponential/Logarithmic: `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`
- Constants: `pi`, `e`

## Tips:
- Use parentheses for complex functions to ensure correct order of operations
- The derivative is calculated numerically, so very steep functions might show approximation errors
- Experiment with multiple functions and derivative orders
- Critical values help identify important points like local maxima, minima, and inflection points

## Keyboard Shortcuts (in Navigation Toolbar):
- **Left-click and drag**: Pan
- **Right-click and drag**: Zoom
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
