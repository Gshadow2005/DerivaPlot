# DerivaPlot - Function Visualization Tool
DerivaPlot is a Python-based application that enables visualization of mathematical functions, their derivatives, and integrals using computational methods.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice:
**Known Issue**: The current version has accuracy problems with derivative and integral calculations. The computational formulas and solving functions contain errors that may produce incorrect results. This issue is under review and will be addressed in future updates.

## How to Use DerivaPlot:
1. **Enter a mathematical function using x as the variable**
   - Examples: `sin(x)`, `x**2`, `cos(x) + 0.5*x`
2. **Set the X Range for plotting (min and max values)**
   - Example: `-10 to 10`
3. **Set the derivative order**
   - 1 for the first derivative, 2 for the second, etc.
4. **Additional Features:**
   - Click "+ Add Function" to plot multiple functions simultaneously
   - Use the "Show Critical Values" button to identify key points on the function
   - Use the "Show Roots" button to find and display function roots
   - Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing
5. **Click "Plot Functions" to visualize:**
   - The original function
   - The specified derivative
   - The integral of the function
6. **Use the navigation toolbar to:**
   - Zoom in/out
   - Pan the graph
   - Save the plot directly
7. **Additional Buttons:**
   - "Save Image": Export the graph as PNG, JPEG, or PDF
   - "Generate Report": Create a comprehensive function analysis report
   - "Refresh": Update the plot without clearing inputs
   - "Reset": Clear all inputs and reset the graph

## Supported Mathematical Functions:
- Basic Operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`
- Trigonometric: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- Exponential/Logarithmic: `exp`, `log`, `sqrt`
- Constants: `pi`, `e`

## Known Limitations:
- **Accuracy Issues**: Derivative and integral calculations may be incorrect due to flawed computational formulas
- **Numerical Approximation**: Even when working correctly, the derivative calculations are numerical approximations, so very steep functions might show approximation errors
- **Verification Recommended**: Always cross-check important results with other mathematical tools or analytical solutions

## Tips:
- Use parentheses for complex functions to ensure correct order of operations
- Experiment with multiple functions and derivative orders
- Critical values help identify important points like local maxima, minima, and inflection points
- **Important**: Due to known accuracy issues, verify all critical calculations with alternative methods

## Keyboard Shortcuts (in Navigation Toolbar):
- **Left-click and drag**: Pan
- **Right-click and drag**: Zoom
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
